This page shows some of the many ways Pymunk can be used. I hope you find them
 as inspiring as I do!

If you also have done something using Pymunk please let me know, and I can

        A game of fun, shooting, and "I'm sorry to put you through this".

        A fabricator robot on Mars was supposed to make a bunch of robots! 
        But it got lazy and made robots that could make other robots. And 
        it made them smarter than they should have been. Now they've all 
        gone off and hidden away behind various tanks and computers. 
        
        Happily, he knew how to construct *you*, a simple fighting robot. 
        It's your job to clean out each area!

        Satisfying simulations of bouncing balls obeying physical laws; for 
        a fleeting moment during the simulation, the balls pass through a 
        beautiful regular arrangement.

        Each sequence is obtained by joining two simulations, both starting 
        from the time in which the balls are arranged regularly. One 
        simulates forward in time, one backwards.

        multidimensional search space of vehicle speed, chassis width, chassis 
        height and wheel radius, to find a variety of configurations among 
        which few are successful in helping the car cross the track.
