This page shows some of the many ways Pymunk can be used. I hope you find them
as inspiring as I do!

This is not a complete list of everything made with Pymunk, just some of the

A game of fun, shooting, and "I'm sorry to put you through this".

A fabricator robot on Mars was supposed to make a bunch of robots! But it got 
lazy and made robots that could make other robots. And it made them smarter 
than they should have been. Now they've all gone off and hidden away behind 
various tanks and computers. Happily, he knew how to construct *you*, a simple 
fighting robot. It's your job to clean out each area!

.. figure:: _static/auto-icenav.jpg
   :target: https://github.com/rdesc/AUTO-IceNav

Ice conditions often require ships to reduce speed and deviate from their main 
course to avoid damage to the ship. In addition, broken ice fields are 
becoming the dominant ice conditions encountered in the Arctic, where the 
effects of collisions with ice are highly dependent on where contact occurs and
on the particular features of the ice floes. AUTO-IceNav is a framework for 
the autonomous navigation of ships operating in ice floe fields.
