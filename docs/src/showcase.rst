        A game of fun, shooting, and "I'm sorry to put you through this".

        A fabricator robot on Mars was supposed to make a bunch of robots! 
        But it got lazy and made robots that could make other robots. And 
        it made them smarter than they should have been. Now they've all 
        gone off and hidden away behind various tanks and computers. 
        
        Happily, he knew how to construct *you*, a simple fighting robot. 
        It's your job to clean out each area!

        This is a Galton Board simulation programmed to run in three modes, 
        with medium sized balls, small balls and large balls. A bit of 
        randomness had to be added to the ball elasticity and initialization 
        positions, to aid with proper interaction with objects.

        Among the simplest AI algorithms: Differential Evolution. Brought to 
        life with Pymunk and Pygame. Each car has an objective of reaching the 
        end of the track, but has only 15 seconds to do so. They explore the 
        multidimensional search space of vehicle speed, chassis width, chassis 
        height and wheel radius, to find a variety of configurations among 
        which few are successful in helping the car cross the track.

        feature of most PLC simulators. Paired with a game library and 2d 
        physics engine, VirtuaPlant is able to present a GUI simulating the 
        "world view" behind the control system allowing the user to have a 
        vision of the would-be actions behind the control systems.
