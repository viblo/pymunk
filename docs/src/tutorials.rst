Pymunk has one tutorial that show a simple simulation from start to end.

After reading it make sure to also check out the :ref:`Examples <examples>` as 
most of them are easy to follow and showcase many of the things you can do with 
pymunk. Also take a look at the external tutorials. While they are not created 
by the Pymunk creator they can still give a good start in how to use Pymunk.
