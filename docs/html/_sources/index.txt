**********************************
Welcome to pymunk's documentation! 
**********************************

pymunk is a easy-to-use pythonic 2d physics library that can be used whenever 
you need 2d rigid body physics from Python. It is built on top of the very 
nice 2d physics library Chipmunk.


Getting Started
===============

To get started quickly take a look in the :doc:`readme`, it contains a 
summary of the most important things and is quick to read. When done its a 
good idea to take a look at the included :doc:`examples`, read the 
:doc:`tutorials` and take a look in the :doc:`pymunk`.


The pymunk Vision
=================

    "*Make 2d physics easy to include in your game*"

It is (or is striving to be):

* **Easy to use** - It should be easy to use, no complicated stuff should be 
  needed to add physics to your game/program.
* **"Pythonic"** - It should not be visible that a c-library (chipmunk) is in 
  the bottom, it should feel like a python library (no strange naming, OO, 
  no memory handling and more)
* **Simple to build & install** - You shouldnt need to have a zillion of 
  libraries installed to make it install, or do a lot of command line trixs.
* **Multiplatform** - Should work on both windows, \*nix and OSX.
* **Non-intrusive** - It should not put restrictions on how you structure 
  your program and not force you to use a special game loop, it should be 
  possible to use with other libraries like pygame and pyglet. 


Contact & Support
=================

**Stackoverflow**
    You can ask questions/browse old ones at stackoverflow, just look for 
    the pymunk tag. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pymunk

**Forum**
    Currently pymunk has no separate forum, but you can use the general 
    Chipmunk forum at http://chipmunk-physics.net/forum/index.php Many issues 
    are the same, like how to create a rag doll or why a fast moving object 
    pass through a wall. If you have a pymunk specific question you can mark 
    your post with [pymunk] to make it stand out a bit.

**E-Mail**

Regardless of the method you use I will try to answer your questions as soon 
as I see them. (And if you ask on on SO or the forum other people might help 
as well!)
