        :subscript:`made by Samiran Roy. Retrieved 2016-10-27`

        An open source Carrom Simulator interface for testing 
        intelligent/learning agents. It provides an interface that allows 
        you to design agents that that play carrom. It is built in python, 
        using pygame + pymunk. This is the course project for 
        CS 747 - Foundations of Intelligent and Learning Agents, taught by 
        Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan at IIT Bombay.

        A project that trains a virtual car to how to move an object around a 
        screen (drive itself) without running into obstacles using a type of 
        reinforcement learning called Q-Learning.
