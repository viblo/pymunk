        bodies and makes several passes over the list considering each one
        individually. The number of passes it makes is the iteration count,

        many iterations, the physics should look nice and solid, but may use
        up too much CPU time. If you use too few iterations, the simulation
        may seem mushy or bouncy when the objects should be solid. Setting
        the number of iterations lets you balance between CPU usage and the
        accuracy of the physics. Pymunk's default of 10 iterations is

        will find that they get the best performance using from the tree. The
        other available spatial index type available is a spatial hash, which
        can be much faster when you have a very large number (1000s) of
        objects that are all the same size. For smaller numbers of objects,
        or objects that vary a lot in size, the spatial hash is usually much
        slower. It also requires tuning (usually through experimentation) to
        get the best possible performance.

        The spatial hash data is fairly size sensitive. dim is the size of
        the hash cells. Setting dim to the average collision shape size is
        likely to give the best performance. Setting dim too small will cause
        the shape to be inserted into many cells, setting it too low will
        cause too many objects into the same hash slot.

        count is the suggested minimum number of cells in the hash table. If
        there are too few cells, the spatial hash will return many false
        positives. Too many cells will be hard on the cache and waste memory.
        Setting count to ~10x the number of objects in the space is probably a
        good starting point. Tune from there if necessary.
