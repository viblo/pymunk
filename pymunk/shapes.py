            >>> w, h = 10, 20
            >>> vs = [(-w/2,-h/2), (w/2,-h/2), (w/2,h/2), (-w/2,h/2)]

            Vec2d(0.0, 0.0)

            Or use a transform to move them:

            >>> width, height = 10, 20
            >>> vs = [(0, 0), (width, 0), (width, height), (0, height)]
            >>> poly_bad = Poly(None, vs)
            >>> print(poly_bad.center_of_gravity)
            Vec2d(5.0, 10.0)
            >>> t = Transform(tx=-width/2, ty=-height/2)
            >>> poly_good = Poly(None, vs, transform=t)
            >>> print(poly_good.center_of_gravity)
